# BASIC IDEA OF COMPUTING 

*computing basically means doing computation, and as we know ***NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF ALL INVENTIONS*** *similar in this case for getting our day to day life jobs gets much easier,
a device called computer get invented.

## HOW COMPUTATIONS WORK?

*im not saying exactly but basically ***CLASSICAL COMPUTERS*** *are made of transistors which have two possible states on or off digitally which we call 0 & 1 (bits)
and all computations happens by the manipulations of these bits using many logics.

### PARTS INVOLVED 

*now the  computer are divided into many parts like ***CPU*** *where all the computations takes place ***MEMORY*** *where actual data is stored.










**NOW BASICALLY WE ARE GOING TO DO HERE IS THERE IS NEED OF SOME OPERATOR WHICH CAN COORDINATES ALL THE HARDWARES TO DO COMPUTATIONS IN THE WAY WE WANT IT TO SO, FROM HERE OS CAME IN TO 
SPOTLIGHT, AND WE GONNA HOP IN TO LINUX WITH LEARNING SOME OF ITS HISTORY**
