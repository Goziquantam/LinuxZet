# TERMINAL VS SHELL 

*SHELL IS AN INTERACTIVE PROGRAM  WHICH IS AN INTERFACE BETWEEN THE KERNEL OF AN OS AND USER, AND TERMINAL IS BASICALLY AN APPLICATION WHERE WE PUT INPUTS AND SHELL GETS OUR JOB DONE 
AND WE GET OUTPUT, SO BASICALLY WE CAN SAY THAT **SHELL IS WHATS INSIDE OF AN TERMINAL AND TERMINAL DISPLAYS EVERYTHING WHICH WE ASKED TO BE DONE THROUGH COMMANDS AND SHELL IS WHAT MAKES IT HAPPEN**
AND THE INPUTS WE GIVE IN TERMINAL ARE SINGLE LINED COMMAND KNOWN AS **COMMAND LINE** *.
