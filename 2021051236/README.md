# HISTORY OF LINUX 

*LINUX OS WAS MADE BY LINUS TORVALDZ A STUDENT AT HELINISKY UNIVERSITY INSPIRED FROM  MINIS AN OS MADE BY HIS PROFESSOR FOR TEACHING BUT HE DIDNT USED THE SOURCE CODE OD MINIS 
BUT THE IDEOLOGY WAS SAME THAT OF UNIX BUT NOTHING IN THE SOURCE CODE WAS COPIED SO, LINUX GOT ITS BOOST AFTER COLLBRATING WITH RICHARD STALLMAN AND GETTING **GPL LICENESE** TO LINUX 
SUCH THAT IT BECAME COMPLETELY OPEN SOURCE AND STARTED GEETING CONTRIBUTION FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND ITS STILL GROWING*

## WHY LINUX??

*FROM THE HACKER POINT OF VIEW I CAN SAY THAT LINUX I SO SAFE BECOZ NOONE CAN CHANGE ITS SETTINGS AND CONFIGURATION UNTIL THEY GOT THE ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGES*.
